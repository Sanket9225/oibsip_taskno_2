                <ul id="pr">
                    <li>Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born in <strong> on October 30, 1909 to Jehangir and Meherbai
                            Bhabha</strong>.
                        Jehangir Bhabha had grown up in <strong>Bangalore</strong> and was educated at
                        <strong>Oxford</strong>. After receiving his
                        training as a lawyer in England, Jehangir started working in Mysore where he joined the judicial
                        service of the state. He married Meherbai, daughter of Bhikaji Framji Pandey and granddaughter
                        of the renowned philanthropist, Dinshaw Petit of Bombay. After marriage, the couple moved to
                        Bombay, the first commercial city of British India where young Bhabha spent his childhood.

                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Homi had his schooling at the <strong>Cathedral and John Connon School, Bombay</strong>, which,
                        he would observe
                        years later, did much to foster his love for science. Then he entered <strong>Elphinstone
                            College</strong> at age 15
                        after passing his <strong>Senior Cambridge Examination</strong> with Honours.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>He then attended the <strong>Royal Institute of Science</strong> in 1927 before joining Caius
                        College of
                        Cambridge University. This was due to the insistence of his father and his uncle Dorabji, who
                        planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in mechanical engineering from Cambridge and then return
                        to India, where he would join the Tata Steel or Tata Steel Mills in Jamshedpur as a
                        metallurgist.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>In January 1933</strong>, Bhabha received his <strong>doctorate in nuclear
                            physics</strong> after publishing his first
                        scientific paper, <strong>"The Absorption of Cosmic radiation"</strong>. In the paper, Bhabha
                        offered an
                        explanation of the absorption features and electron shower production in cosmic rays. In 1935,
                        Bhabha published a paper in the <strong>Proceedings of the Royal Society</strong>, Series A, in
                        which he
                        performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering.
                        Electron-positron scattering was later named <strong>Bhabha scattering</strong>, in honour of
                        his contributions
                        in the field. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bhabha established the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute, began to work on the theory of
                        point particles movement, while independently conducting research on nuclear weapons in 1944.In
                        1945, he established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, and the Atomic Energy
                        Commission in 1948, serving as its first chairman.In 1948, Nehru led the appointment of Bhabha
                        as the director of the nuclear program and tasked Bhabha to develop the nuclear weapons soon
                        after.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <ul>
                    <li>In the 1950s, Bhabha represented India in IAEA conferences, and served as President of the
                        United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland in 1955.
                        During this time, he intensified his lobbying for the development of nuclear weapons. Soon after
                        the Sino-Indo war, Bhabha aggressively and publicly began to call for the nuclear weapons.</li>

                        Homi Jenhagir Bhabha (1909-1966) was an Indian physicist who is often considered the
                        <strong>father of
                            the Indian nuclear program</strong>.

                    <li>
                        Bhabha died when <strong>Air India Flight 101 crashed near Mont Blanc on 24 January
                            1966</strong>.
                        Misunderstanding between Geneva Airport and the pilot about the aircraft position near the
                        mountain is the official reason of the crash.

            <ul id="pr">
                <li>Dr. Bhabha was of course deeply interested in cosmic ray physics which was in those days the
                    only natural way to provide information on the nature of high energy interactions, and thereby the
                    structure of the nucleus
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the TIFR that he translocated later on to Mumbai, Dr. Bhabha decided
                    to grow several areas of research at the TIFR, prominent among which were: Cosmic Ray
                    physics, Theoretical Physics and pure Mathematics. This was a master stroke as time would
                    show the great advantage of having related/mixed scientific disciplines in one institute.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The TIFR
                    besides serving as a cradle to the highly successful program of Atomic Energy in India, gained
                    international recognition in the fields of, <strong>ray physics, theoretical physics and mathematics</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Besides the reasons given above for giving high priority to cosmic ray research, there was
                    another important reason also for which Dr. Bhabha had a very sound basis. The primary cosmic
                    ray spectra extends to the lowest energies, few MeV: it also extends to energies beyond 1014
                    MeV. The differential spectrum follows a power law with a slope of (-2.5).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dr. Bhabha realized that it would be ideal to work with the cosmic ray beam in
                    India to study the basic structure of nuclear matter and the nature of elementary particles. His
                    conclusion was borne out by successive studies carried out at the TIFR, which made important
                    discoveries in the field of high energy physics and elementary particles, and put India on the map
                    of fundamental research in the fields of cosmic ray physics, high energy physics and elementary
                    particles.
